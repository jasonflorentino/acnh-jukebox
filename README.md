# 📀 ACNH Jukebox

**A Web app for playing K.K. Slider jams like in Animal Crossing: New Horizons**

Started as a little toy project to play around with Next.js and boy am I hooked -- Next is awesome! Also the art and music of this game are just too good NOT to get lost in. Enjoy!

## To Do, maybe
💭 Determine loop times for more songs  
💭 Song name language selector  
💭 Load to scroll location of last played song  
💭 Play/Pause button? Or 'scroll to current song' button?  
✅ Background waves  
✅ Play random song, button similar to in-game buttons  
✅ Prune Next page props  
✅ Footer content + animate in?  
✅ Better music looping  
✅ Use different fonts  
✅ Update to Next 12  
✅ Remove Tailwind
