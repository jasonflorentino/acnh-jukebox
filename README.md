# ðŸ“€ ACNH Jukebox

**A Web app for playing K.K. Slider jams like in Animal Crossing: New Horizons**

Started as a little toy project to play around with Next.js and boy am I hooked -- Next is awesome! Also the art and music of this game are just too good NOT to get lost in. Enjoy!

ðŸ’­ Song name language selector  
ðŸ’­ Load to scroll location of last played song  
ðŸ’­ Add "Actions Buttons" container  
ðŸ’­ Play/Pause button? Or 'scroll to current song' button?  
ðŸ’­ Search?  
âœ… Background waves  
âœ… Play random song, button similar to in-game buttons  
âœ… Prune Next page props  
âœ… Footer content + animate in?  
âœ… Better music looping  
âœ… Use different fonts  
âœ… Update to Next 12  
âœ… Remove Tailwind  
âœ… Notify limited features on mobile browers
